# epi_image_analysis
Use the bash code to pull out the tif-files generated by the Lois lab epifluorescence microscope from the Pos0 folder. The notebook then enhances the contrast of the images using the skimage.equalize_adapthist function and performs color grading. It saves the images as 8-bit tif files with a Lookup Table (LUT) and a scale bar (defined under "parameters" inside the notebook) in a new folder.
